name: git-clone

short_description:
  It clones a repository into a new directory.

full_description:
  This command creates an empty Git repository â€” basically a `.git` directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD of the master branch is also created.
  If you provide a directory, the command is run inside it. If this directory does not exist, it will be created. Running `git init` in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite things that are already there.
